            'By utilizing Jenn\'s nutrition plan, for the first time in my life I found a healthy balance of the right amounts of foods and nutrients for my body. Instead of "dieting" and denying myself (always hungry), she helped me find the right foods to fuel my body and feel my best. My mentality went from depriving myself to making sure I add the right foods to be nutritious. She was consistent with checking in, and also a great encouragement. Her exercise plan was perfectly targeted to do from home or the gym and helped me focus areas I wanted to target, and gradually increased in intensity.',

            'My husband and I worked with Jenn doing a nutrition plan for several months. I had previously tried working with another nutrition program and did not succeed. With Jenn however, I did. What sets her apart from others is not only her cost (which for many is a big factor) but her drive and knowledge. She made sure to tailor a plan that was not only simple for both my husband and I, it was similar so we weren’t having to make additional meals for each, but also worked for our kids too. She also unlike many other coaches follows up. She is available to ask questions and get clarification. If something isn’t working she changes it. She is incredibly knowledgeable when it comes to women and their hormones and how to adjust things your body may be lacking. She provided some great suggestions and alternative things for my husband who has an autoimmune disease. Both my husband and I saw great results. The best part, is it wasn’t a chore to follow and something we have adapted into our daily lifestyle. We both highly recommend working with Jenn!',

            "I wanted to get firmer, stronger and thinner on Jenn's program. More than that though I wanted a lifestyle change. With Jenn's help I found a nutrition program that has helped me with my stomach troubles and evened out my blood sugar highs and lows. As a 40 year old super busy mom of four I managed to lose some weight during the six weeks but better yet I've gained a nutrition and lifestyle change that will be easy to continue with indefinitely. Thanks Jenn!!",

I thought what we had to do in such time wouldn't be achievable but I trusted her and the process and did it. She was nice, understanding, and easy going. I wanted to quit and she didn't let me. I went in 14-12 weeks from 155-138. I was blown away and placed at my show. This was a huge accomplishment for me.",

This 6-week plan has been the most inspirational and I've lost inches and 10lbs!!! Not only am I following meal plans and workouts, I'm actually SUCCEEDING for the first time in my life and meeting a life-long goal of being healthy and fit AND I eat more food more often then before. It has made me more disciplined and I feel like the best version of myself! Thank you Jenn for inspiring me and teaching me how to live a healthy lifestyle. I look forward to another 6 weeks on the plan and the rest of my lifetime fitness journey!",
